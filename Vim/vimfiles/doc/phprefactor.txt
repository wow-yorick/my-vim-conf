SETUP                                                         *PhpRefactorSetup*

Before you can use this plugin you will need to download php-refactoring-browser
from https://github.com/QafooLabs/php-refactoring-browser

Next you will need to put refactor.phar some where safe and add the following
config to your .vimrc

let g:php_refactor_command='php /path/to/refactor.phar'

This plugin also requires the patch command so I'm not sure if it will work on
Windows.

Once this application is installed you can simply use the |PhpRefactorMappings|
mappings in PHP files to perform the various refactorings.
