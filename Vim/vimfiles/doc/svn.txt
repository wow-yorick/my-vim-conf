2. svn.vim Installation                                         *svn-install*

The svn plugin is comprised of two files, svn.vim and svn.txt (this file).
To install the plugin, place svn.vim in a plugin directory in your runtime
path (usually ~/.vim/plugin/ works fine) (see |add-global-plugin| and
|'runtimepath'|).        

This help file can be included in the VIM help system by copying it into a
'doc' directory in your runtime path and then executing the |:helptags|
command, specifying the full path of the 'doc' directory.  Please see
|add-local-help| for more details.

3. svn.vim Introduction	                                          *svn-intro*

The svn plugin provides global commands for interacting with your svn
repositories.  svn.vim was initially created as an answer to doing commits
from within gvim, so it is tailored slightly to gvim users (in my opinion)
though all of its features and calls should work fine in any vim >= 6.0.

svn.vim assumes your current working directory (if your vim instance) is
some place in the repository of the file you are working on (the root of it
or otherwise).  This should be no problem for console vim users, though I
dont know if all gvim users chdir thier vim after starting it (I do...but
I'm not everyone am I ? :))  If you dont and you want svn.vim to work properly
you should start the habit of chdiring to the repository of the file you are
working on.

Each svn command is mapped to a key sequence starting with the <Leader>
and <LocalLeader> keystrokes.  The default mappings may be overriden by 
supplying a different mapping before the plugin is loaded.  
~/.gvimrc is a good place for this, usually.  If you dont know what this
means, then it means you probably start each key sequence with "\\", so if 
you were to want to commit, and say the keystroke is "c", then you would
enter the sequence "\\c".

4. svn.vim Manual					         *svn-manual*

4.1 How Handlers Work 

All svn.vim commands start with 'Svn' or 'SVN' (each is registered to the 
 same routine).  There are a few old shortcuts that still exist, these
are exceptions.  The shortcuts that are Commit, Complete, Update, Add,
and Log.   If you supply through a command that isn't handled specially by
svn.vim, it will be passed on to svn itself and executed in your editors
current working directory.

4.2 Special Handlers

Special Handlers in svn.vim are:

commit   - This handler, instead of simply executing svn commit, will simply
           open a buffer for editing your revision comments.  This buffer
           should be identical to the one svn regularly supplies when using
           svn commit normally.  But svn will not be running.  To complete
           the commiting process, you must use svn complete

complete - This is a special svn.vim only command.  It takes the current
           data in the current buffer, and wraps an sh script around it.
           This sh script takes a single parameter, which it writes the
           current buffer to.  The svn commit command is then called, being
           fed an enviroment variable for 'EDITOR' which is the sh script
           written by this special handler.  Then the script is removed,
           and svn update is called in your repository.

log      - This is much similar to the svn command log, but it creates a
           new buffer and fills it with the log data.

add      - This will add the filename in the current buffer to the repository.

help     - This pulls up this file, instead of passing 'help' on to svn.

4.2 Mappings					                  *svn-keys*	

By default, a mapping is defined for each command.  These mappings execute the
default (no-argument) form of each command.

<Leader><LocalLeader>c  - Calls :Svn commit
<Leader><LocalLeader>C  - Calls :Svn complete
<Leader><LocalLeader>u  - Calls :Svn update
<Leader><LocalLeader>l  - Calls :Svn log
<Leader><LocalLeader>a  - Calls :Svn add
